# ðŸ”Ž The Search for Angelo

**The Search for Angelo** is a small project aimed at finding an old friend called "Angelo" who suddenly disappeared from his old account on Roblox.

This search is being done for one of my friends, as he is the one who has lost (and needs to find) his friend.

## ðŸ“š The Lore

From hereon, my friend which needs help with finding this person will be referred to as *X*.

**Angelo**, or rather **[Skypaperplanes](https://www.roblox.com/users/1301057080/profile/)**, is a person with whom  *X* was friends with. They became friends with eachother around 2019, meeting inside of a [military themed game](https://www.roblox.com/games/986331525/Nuke-Site).

Knowing the game and what was done in it is irrelevant to the search itself, but *X* vividly recalls standing inside a radio tower with **Skypaperplanes** in that game. They also played many admin games and the aforementioned game constantly. Apart from that, *X*'s memory is murky.

One day, **Skypaperplanes** said that *X* was his best online friend, and he wished *X* a "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year". Afterwards, he revealed that he will be moving Roblox accounts and that his name is **Angelo**.

*X* recalls receiving a friend request from **Angelo**, however *X* accidentaly unfriended him whilst cleaning out his friends list on Roblox. Nonetheless, their friendship still stands as **Angelo** still follows *X* and their chat logs suggest a nice friendship.

## ðŸ”¨ The information we're working with

We aren't left with much information, apart from the following:

- Name is ``Angelo``
    - Also goes by `Andy`

- They have only ``1`` game in their creations tab which are **publicly shown**
    - Please note the differences between having only 1 game *created* and having only 1 game *publically listed* on their profile. This differentiation is done within the Roblox API.

- Display names did not exist at the time, therefore "Angelo" must definitely be in the username.
